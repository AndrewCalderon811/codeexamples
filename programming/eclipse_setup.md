# Eclipse Links CSC110 & CSC205

## Getting Ready for CSC110 & CSC205

If you have not already done so, [download Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).  The classroom & lab PCs should have Eclipse Photon & Java 8 installed, but any earlier version of Eclipse for Java Developers should be sufficient for the work we will do in CSC205.  

Then, once you have Eclipse installed, you should download the class example & starter code from GitHub (the videos are here also).  Then you should regularly update your project to ensure you have the latest code.  

- VIDEO: [Importing a project from GitHub repository into Eclipse](https://youtu.be/q-ItQbNzGd8) (note that CSC205 students should email me their GitHub username first to be given access to the repo)
- VIDEO: [Keeping Eclipse Up-to-Date with GitHub](https://youtu.be/neIAbG9hLqU) walks through the steps to make sure you always have the most up-to-date code from GitHub, which is important for projects

## Eclipse Tutorials

- [Eclipse tutorial](http://eclipsetutorial.sourceforge.net/totalbeginner.html)
- An [Eclipse set up guide](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/eclipsejava_howto.html) that also walks through [installing the Java SDK](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/JDK_HowTo.html#jdk-install)

## Git & GitHub

Class example code will be posted on GitHub.  We will also be doing projects that require GitHub to download the starter code. It will be a good idea now to spend some time learning how it works.

- You will first need to set up [Git on your computer](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git).  
- If you have an older version of Eclipse (recent version already include it) can install Git integration into Eclipse using [EGit](https://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/).  If you decide to use EGit, make sure you go through the configuration steps listed in the [User's Guide](https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide).  
- I found [this tutorial](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGit/article.html) a bit better than the ones from the official site.

You may also want to practice using GitHub to keep your assignments, but if you do make sure you use a private repo.
