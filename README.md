# Code Examples, Notes & Links

Code examples, notes, and links for my classes, specifically programming in C (CSC220, CSC240), C++ (CSC220, CSC240), Java (CSC205), Scheme (CSC240), and Prolog (CSC240) and using Linux & writing bash scripts (CSC220).  The videos and examples are geared toward the goals of the class, so some of the techniques covered may not necessarily be best practice and the code may not be the most concise or efficient.  

For the most part, I have left mistakes (whether intentional or not) in the videos, but the code should be mistake free, so please let me know if you see any code examples with (uncommented) mistakes.  You should check the git history for each code example - if the last commit is not "Sync with video" or something similar then there was likely a code change after the video was complete.  A note should be in the entry for that file in the README.md file in that directory.

For my students you should also refer to the material on Canvas and the GitHub repo specific to your class.
